# Environments

This article explains what environments are and how to create and use them.

Environments are one type of [workload asset](workload-assets.md#asset-scope). An environment consists of a configuration that simplifies how workloads are submitted and can be used by AI practitioners when they submit their workloads.

An environment asset is a preconfigured building block that encapsulates aspects for the workload such as:

* Container image and container configuration
* Tools and connections
* The type of workload it serves

### Environments table

The Environments table can be found under **Workload manager** in the Run:ai platform.

The Environment table provides a list of all the environment defined in the platform and allows you to manage them.

The Environments table consists of the following columns:

### Environments created by Run:ai

When installing Run:ai, you automatically get the environments created by Run:ai to ease up the onboarding process and support different use cases out of the box.\
These environments are created at the [scope](workload-assets.md#asset-scope) of the account.

| Environment         | Image                                                 |

### Adding a new environment

Environment creation is limited to [specific roles](workload-assets.md#who-can-create-an-asset)

To add a new environment:

1. Go to the Environments table
2. Click **+NEW ENVIRONMENT**
3. Select under which cluster to create the environment
4. Select a [scope](workload-assets.md#asset-scope)
5. Enter a **name** for the environment. The name must be unique.
6. Optional: Provide a **description** of the essence of the environment
7. Enter the **Image URL**\
   If a token or secret is required to pull the image, it is possible to create it via [credentials of type docker registry](credentials.md#docker-registry). These credentials are automatically used once the image is pulled (which happens when the workload is submitted)
8. Set the **image pull policy** - the condition for when to pull the image from the registry
9. Set the workload architecture:
   * **Standard**\
     Only standard workloads can use the environment. A standard workload consists of a single process.
   * **Distributed**\
     Only distributed workloads can use the environment. A distributed workload consists of multiple processes working together. These processes can run on different nodes.
     * Select a framework from the list.
10. Set the workload type:
    * **Workspace**
    * **Training**
    * **Inference**
      * When inference is selected, define the **endpoint** of the model by providing both the protocol and the containerâ€™s serving port
11. Optional: Set the connection for your **tool(s)**. The tools must be configured in the image. When submitting a workload using the environment, it is possible to connect to these tools
    * Select the tool from the list (the available tools varies from IDE, experiment tracking, and more, including a custom tool for your choice)
    * Select the connection type
      * **External URL**
        * **Auto generate**\
          A unique URL is automatically created for each workload using the environment
        * **Custom URL**\
          The URL is set manually
      * **Node port**
        * **Auto generate**\
          A unique port is automatically exposed for each workload using the environment
        * **Custom URL**\
          Set the port manually
      * Set the **container port**
12. Optional: Set a **command and arguments** for the container running the pod
    * When no command is added, the default command of the image is used (the image entrypoint)
    * The command can be modified while submitting a workload using the environment
    * The argument(s) can be modified while submitting a workload using the environment
13. Optional: **Set the environment variable(s)**
    * Click **+ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE**
    * Enter a **name**
    * Select the **source** for the environment variable
      * **Custom**
        * Enter a **value**
        * Leave **empty**
        * Add **instructions** for the expected value if any
      * **Credentials** - Select existing credentials as the environment variable
        * Select a **credential name**\
          To add new credentials to the credentials list, and for additional information, see [Credentials](credentials.md).
        * Select a **secret key**
    * The environment variables can be modified and new variables can be added while submitting a workload using the environment
14. Optional: Set the containerâ€™s **working directory** to define where the containerâ€™s process starts running. When left empty, the default directory is used.
15. Optional: Set where the UID, GID and supplementary groups are taken from, this can be:
    * **From the image**
    * **From the IdP token** (only available in an SSO installations)
    * **Custom** (manually set) - decide whether the submitter can modify these value upon submission.
      * Set the **User ID (UID)**, **Group ID (GID)** and the supplementary groups that can run commands in the container
        * Enter **UID**
        * Enter **GID**
        * Add **Supplementary groups** (multiple groups can be added, separated by commas)
        * Disable **Allow the values above to be modified within the workload** if you want the above values to be used as the default
16. Optional: Select **Linux capabilities** - Grant certain privileges to a container without granting all the privileges of the root user.
17. Click **CREATE ENVIRONMENT**

{% hint style="info" %}
It is also possible to add data sources directly when creating a specific [workspace](../../experiment-using-workspaces/), [training](../../train-models-using-training/) or [inference](../../deploy-models-using-inference/) workload.
