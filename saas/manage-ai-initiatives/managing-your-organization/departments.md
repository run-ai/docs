# Departments

This article explains the procedure for managing departments

Departments are a grouping of projects. By grouping projects into a department, you can set quota limitations to a set of projects, create policies that are applied to the department, and create assets that can be scoped to the whole department or a partial group of descendent projects

For example, in an academic environment, a department can be the Physics Department grouping various projects (AI Initiatives) within the department, or grouping projects where each project represents a single student.

### Departments

The Departments table can be found under **Organization** in the Run:ai platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
Departments are disabled, by default. If you cannot see Departments in the menu, then it must be enabled by your Administrator, under **General settings** → Resources → Departments
{% endhint %}

The Departments table lists all departments defined for a specific cluster and allows you to manage them. You can switch between clusters by selecting your cluster using the filter at the top.

The Departments table consists of the following columns:

| Column                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Adding a new department

To create a new Department:

1. Click **+NEW DEPARTMENT**
2. Select a **scope**.\
   By default, the field contains the scope of the current UI context cluster, viewable at the top left side of your screen. You can change the current UI context cluster by clicking the ‘Cluster: cluster-name’ field and applying another cluster as the UI context. Alternatively, you can choose another cluster within the ‘+ New Department’ form by clicking the organizational tree icon on the right side of the scope field, opening the organizational tree and selecting one of the available clusters.
3. Enter a **name** for the department. Department names must start with a letter and can only contain lower case latin letters, numbers or a hyphen ('-’).
4. Under **Quota Management**, select a quota for the department. The Quota management section may contain different fields depending on pre-created system configuration. Possible system configurations are:
   * Existence of Node Pools
   * CPU Quota - Allow setting a quota for CPU resources.

When no node pools are configured, you can set the following quota parameters:

* **GPU Devices**\
  The number of GPUs you want to allocate for this department (decimal number). This quota is consumed by the department’s subordinated project.
* **CPUs (cores)** (when CPU quota is set)\
  The number of CPU cores you want to allocate for this department (decimal number). This quota is consumed by the department’s subordinated projects
* **CPUs memory** (when CPU quota is set)\
  The amount of CPU memory you want to allocate for this department (in Megabytes or Gigabytes). This quota is consumed by the department’s subordinated projects

When node pools are enabled, it is possible to set the above quota parameters **for each node-pool separately**.

* In addition, you can decide whether to allow a department to go over quota. Allowing over quota at the department level means that one department can receive more resources than its quota when not required by other departments. If the over quota is disabled, workloads running under subordinated projects are not able to use more resources than the department’s quota, but each project can still go over quota (if enabled at the project level) up to the department’s quota.

Unlimited CPU(Cores) and CPU memory quotas are an exception - in this case, workloads of subordinated projects can consume available resources up to the physical limitation of the cluster or any of the node pools.

Example of Quota management:

### Viewing a department’s policy

To view the policy of a department:

1. Select the department for which you want to view its [policies](../../policies/workload-policies.md).\
   This option is only active if the department has defined policies in place.
2. Click **VIEW POLICY** and select the workload type for which you want to view the policies:\
   a. **Workspace** workload type policy with its set of rules\
   b. **Training** workload type policies with its set of rules
3. In the Policy form, view the workload rules that are enforcing your department for the selected workload type as well as the defaults:
   * **Parameter** - The workload submission parameter that Rule and Default is applied on
   * **Type (applicable for data sources only)** - The data source type (Git, S3, nfs, pvc etc.)
   * **Default** - The default value of the Parameter
   * **Rule** - Set up constraints on workload policy fields
   * **Source** - The origin of the applied policy (cluster, department or project)

{% hint style="info" %}
* The policy affecting the department consists of rules and defaults. Some of these rules and defaults may be derived from the policies of a parent cluster (source). You can see the source of each rule in the policy form.
* A policy set for a department affects all subordinated projects and their workloads, according to the policy workload type
{% endhint %}

### Deleting a department

1. Select the department you want to delete
2. Click **DELETE**
3. On the dialog, click **DELETE** to confirm the deletion

{% hint style="info" %}
Deleting a department permanently deletes its subordinated projects, any assets created in the scope of this department, and any of its subordinated projects such as compute resources, environments, data sources, templates, and credentials. However, workloads running within the department’s subordinated projects, or the policies defined for this department or its subordinated projects - remain intact and running.
