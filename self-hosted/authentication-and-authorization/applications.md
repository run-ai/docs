# Applications

This article explains the procedure to manage your organization's applications.

Applications are used for API integrations with Run:ai. An application contains a client ID and a client secret. With the client credentials, you can obtain a token as detailed in [API authentication](../../saas/api-reference/rest-auth.md) and use it within subsequent API calls.

Applications are assigned with [access rules ](accessrules.md)to manage permissions. For example, application **ci-pipeline-prod** is assigned with a **Researcher** role in **Cluster: A**.

## Applications table

The Applications table can be found under **Access** in the Run:ai platform.

The Applications table provides a list of all the applications defined in the platform, and allows you to manage them.

The Applications table consists of the following columns:

| Column         | Description                                        |

| Client ID      | The client ID of the application                   |
| Access rule(s) | The access rules assigned to the application       |
| Last login     | The timestamp for the last time the user signed in |
| Created by     | The user who created the application               |
