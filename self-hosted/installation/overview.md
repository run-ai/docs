# Installation types


The self-hosted option is for organizations that cannot use a SaaS solution due to data leakage concerns.

Run:ai self-hosting comes with two variants:

| Self-hosting Type | Description | 
|-------------------|-------------|
| Connected | The organization can freely download from the internet (though upload is not allowed)    |
| Air-gapped | The organization has no connection to the internet <br> |

The self-hosted installation is priced differently. For further information please talk to Run:ai sales. 

## Self-hosting with Kubernetes vs OpenShift

Run:ai has been certified with a specified set of [Kubernetes distributions](../../saas/cluster-installation/system-requirements.md#kubernetes-distribution). The OpenShift installation is different from the rest. As such, the Run:ai self-hosted installation instructions are divided into two separate sections:

* OpenShift-based installation. See [Run:ai OpenShift installation](ocp/prerequisites.md). The Run:ai operator for OpenShift is [certified](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/operators/detail/60be3acc3308418324b5e9d8){target=_blank} by Red Hat.
* Kubernetes-based installation. See [Run:ai Kubernetes installation](k8s/prerequisites.md).
