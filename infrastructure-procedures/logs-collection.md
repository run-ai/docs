# Logs Collection

This article provides instructions for IT administrators on collecting Run:ai logs for support, including prerequisites, CLI commands, and log file retrieval. It also covers enabling verbose logging for Prometheus and the Run:ai Scheduler.

## Collect logs to send to support

To collect Run:ai logs, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have administrator-level access to the Kubernetes cluster where Run:ai is installed.
* The Run:ai [Administrator Command-Line Interface](../docs/config/cli-admin-install.md) (CLI) must be installed. TBD Sherin

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Run the Command from your local machine or a Bastion Host (secure server). Open a terminal on your local machine (or any machine that has network access to the Kubernetes cluster) where the Run:ai Administrator CLI is installed.
2. Collect the Logs. Execute the following command to collect the logs:

```bash
runai-adm collect-logs
```

This command gathers all relevant Run:ai logs from the system and generate a compressed file.
3. Locate the Generated File. After running the command, note the location of the generated compressed log file. You can retrieve and send this file to Run:ai Support for further troubleshooting.

!!! Note The tar file packages the logs of Run:ai components only. It does not include logs of researcher containers that may contain private information

## Logs verbosity

Increase log verbosity to capture more detailed information, providing deeper insights into system behavior and make it easier to identify and resolve issues.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* Access to the Kubernetes cluster where Run:ai is installed
  * Including [necessary permissions](../authentication-and-authorization/roles.md) to view and modify configurations.
* kubectl installed and configured:
  * The Kubernetes command-line tool, `kubectl`, must be installed and configured to interact with the cluster.
  * Sufficient privileges to edit configurations and view logs.
* Monitoring Disk Space
  * When enabling verbose logging, ensure adequate disk space to handle the increased log output, especially when enabling debug or high verbosity levels.

### Adding verbosity

??? "Adding verbosity to Prometheus" To increase the logging verbosity for Prometheus, follow these steps:

````
1. Edit the `RunaiConfig` to adjust Prometheus log levels. Copy the following command to your terminal:  

``` bash
kubectl edit runaiconfig runai -n runai
```

2. In the configuration file that opens, add or modify the following section to set the log level to `debug`:  

``` yaml
spec:
    prometheus:
        spec:
            logLevel: debug
```

3. Save the changes. To view the Prometheus logs with the new verbosity level, run:  

``` bash
kubectl logs -n runai prometheus-runai-0
```

This command streams the last 100 lines of logs from Prometheus, providing detailed information useful for debugging.

??? "Adding verbosity to the scheduler"

````
To enable extended logging for the Run:ai scheduler:

1. Edit the `RunaiConfig` to adjust scheduler verbosity:  

``` bash
kubectl edit runaiconfig runai -n runai
```

2.  Add or modify the following section under the scheduler settings:  

``` yaml
runai-scheduler:
    args:
        verbosity: 6
```

This increases the verbosity level of the scheduler logs to provide more detailed output.
