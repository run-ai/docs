# Administrator Messages

System administrators can use *Administrator messages* to make announcements to users once they have logged in. These messages typically are used to keep user informed about different aspects of the platform.

To configure an *Administrator message*:

1. Press `General settings`.
2. Expand the *Message from administrator* pane.
3. Press *Message*.
4. Enter your message in the text box. Use the formatting tools in the toolbar to add special formatting or links to the message.
5. Enable the `Display "Don't show this again" checkbox on message to users` to allow the users to see the message only once.
6. Press *Publish* when complete.
