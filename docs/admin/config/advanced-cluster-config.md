Advanced cluster configurations can be used to tailor your Run:ai cluster deployment to meet specific operational requirements and optimize resource management. By fine-tuning these settings, you can enhance functionality, ensure compatibility with organizational policies, and achieve better control over your cluster environment. This article provides guidance on implementing and managing these configurations to adapt the Run:ai cluster to your unique needs.

After the Run:ai cluster is installed, you can adjust various settings to better align with your organization's operational needs and security requirements.

## Edit cluster configurations

Advanced cluster configurations are managed through the runaiconfig [Kubernetes Custom Resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/){target=_blank}. To modify the cluster configurations, use the following command:

```
kubectl edit runaiconfig runai -n runai
```

## Configurations

The following configurations allow you to enable or disable features, control permissions, and customize the behavior of your Run:ai cluster:

| spec.global.replicaCount  (int) | Sets a global number of pod replicas to be created for services that support replication | 1 |
| spec.limitRange.cpuDefaultRequestCpuLimitFactorNoGpu  (string) | Sets a default ratio between the CPU request and the limit for workloads without GPU requests| 0.1 |
| spec.limitRange.memoryDefaultRequestMemoryLimitFactorNoGpu  (string) | Sets a default ratio between the memory request and the limit for workloads without GPU requests | 0.1 |
| spec.limitRange.cpuDefaultRequestGpuFactor (string) | Sets a default amount of CPU allocated per GPU when the CPU is not specified| | 100m |
| spec.limitRange.cpuDefaultLimitGpuFactor (int) | Sets a default CPU limit based on the number of GPUs requested when no CPU limit is specified | NO DEFAULT |
| spec.limitRange.memoryDefaultRequestGpuFactor (string) | Sets a default amount of memory allocated per GPU when the memory is not specified | 100Mi |
| spec.limitRange.memoryDefaultLimitGpuFactor (string) | Sets a default memory limit based on the number of GPUs requested when no memory limit is specified | NO DEFAULT |
| spec.global.core.timeSlicing.mode (string) | Sets the GPU time-slicing mode.Possible values:`timesharing` - all pods on a GPU share the GPU compute time evenly.‘strict’ - each pod gets an exact time slice according to its memory fraction value.`fair` - each pod gets an exact time slice according to its memory fraction value and any unused GPU compute time is split evenly between the running pods.| timesharing |

### Run:ai Managed Nodes

To include or exclude specific nodes from running workloads within a cluster managed by Run:ai, use the `nodeSelectorTerms` flag. For additional details, see [Kubernetes nodeSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector).

Label the nodes using the below:

* key: Label key (e.g., zone, instance-type).
* operator: Operator defining the inclusion/exclusion condition (In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist).
* values: List of values for the key when using In or NotIn.

The below example shows how to exclude nodes by filtering out non-NVIDIA GPUs in a cluster with mixed nodes, based on product type GPU label:

``` bash
nodeSelectorTerms:
- matchExpressions:
  - key: nvidia.com/gpu.product  
    operator: Exists
```
