# Secrets in Workloads

## Kubernetes Secrets

Sometimes you want to use sensitive information within your code. For example passwords, OAuth tokens, or ssh keys. The best practice for saving such information in Kubernetes is via __Kubernetes Secrets__. Kubernetes Secrets let you store and manage sensitive information. Access to secrets is limited via configuration.

A Kubernetes secret may hold multiple __key - value pairs__.

## Using Secrets in Run:ai Workloads

Our goal is to provide Run:ai Workloads with secrets as input in a secure way. Using the Run:ai command line, you will be able to pass a reference to a secret that already exists in Kubernetes. 

## Creating a secret

For details on how to create a Kubernetes secret see: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/){target=_blank}. Here is an example:

``` YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
  namespace: runai-<project-name>
data:
  username: am9obgo=
  password: bXktcGFzc3dvcmQK
```

Then run:
```
kubectl apply -f <file-name>
```

!!! Notes
    * Secrets are base64 encoded
    * Secrets are stored in the scope of a namespace and will not be accessible from other namespaces. Hence the reference to the Run:ai Project name above. Run:ai provides the ability to propagate secrets throughout all Run:ai Projects. See below.

## Attaching a secret to a Workload on Submit

When you submit a new Workload, you will want to connect the secret to the new Workload. To do that, run:

```
runai submit -e <ENV-VARIABLE>=SECRET:<secret-name>,<secret-key> ....
```

For example:

```
runai submit -i ubuntu -e MYUSERNAME=SECRET:my-secret,username
```


### Secrets and Projects

<!-- !!! Important
    The feature described below is not enabled by default in Run:ai cluster installations -->

As per the note above, secrets are namespace-specific. If your secret relates to all Run:ai Projects, do the following to propagate the secret to all Projects:

* Create a secret within the `runai` namespace.
* Run the following once to allow Run:ai to propagate the secret to all Run:ai Projects:

```
runai-adm set secret <secret name> --cluster-wide
```

!!! Reminder
    The Run:ai Administrator CLI can be obtained [here](../runai-setup/config/cli-admin-install.md).

To delete a secret from all Run:ai Projects, run:

```
runai-adm remove secret <secret name> --cluster-wide
```

## Secrets and Policies

A Secret can be set at the policy level. For additional information see [policies guide](policies.md)
