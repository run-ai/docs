This article explains the procedure to manage your organization's applications.

Applications are used for API integrations with Run:ai. An application contains a client ID and a client secret. With the client credentials, you can obtain a token as detailed in [API authentication](../developer/rest-auth.md) and use it within subsequent API calls.

Applications are assigned with Access Rules to manage permissions.
For example, application **ci-pipeline-prod** is assigned with a **Researcher** role in **Cluster: A**. 

## Applications table

The Applications table can be found under **Access** in the Run:ai platform.

The Applications table provides a list of all the applications defined in the platform, and allows you to manage them.
