This article explains the available roles in the Run:ai platform.

A role is a set of permissions that can be assigned to a [subject in a scope](../../admin/authentication/authentication-overview.md).

A permission is a set of actions (View, Edit, Create and Delete) over a Run:ai entity (e.g. projects, workloads, users).Roles table

The Roles table can be found under **Tools & Settings** in the Run:ai platform.

The Roles table displays a list of predefined roles available to users in the Run:ai platform. It is not possible to create additional rules or edit or delete existing rules.

The Roles table consists of the following columns:

        * **View** If checked, an assigned user with this role can view instances of this type of entity within their defined scope

!!! Notes
    Keep the following in mind when upgrading from versions 2.13 or earlier:

    * **Admin** becomes **System Admin** with full access to all managed objects and scopes  
    * **Research Manager** is not automatically assigned to all projects, but to projects set by the relevant **Admin** when assigning this role to a user, group or app  
    * To preserve backwards compatibility, users with the role of **Research Manager** are assigned to all current projects, but not to new projects  
    * To allow the **Department Admin** to assign a **Researcher** role to a user, group or app, the **Department Admin** must have **VECD** permissions for jobs and workspaces. This creates a broader span of managed objects  
    * To preserve backwards compatibility, users with the role of **Editor**, are assigned to the same scope they had before the upgrade. However, with new user assignments, the **Admin** can limit the scope to only part of the organizational scope.

## Permitted workloads

When assigning a role with either one, all or any combination of the View, Edit, Create and Delete permissions for workloads, the subject has permissions to manage not only Run:ai native workloads (Workspace, Training, Inference), but also a list of 3rd party workloads:

* k8s: Pod
* k8s: Deployment
