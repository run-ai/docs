# Role based access control

User authorization to system resources and assets is managed using [Role-based access control(RBAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control){target=_blank}. RBAC is a policy-neutral access control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC make it simple to manage access to system resources and assets.

## RBAC components

Run:ai uses the following components for RBAC:

### Subjects

A *Subject* is an entity that receives the rule. *Subjects* are:

* Users
* Applications
* Groups (SSO only)

### Roles

A role is a combination of entities and actions. Run:ai supports the following roles and actions within the user's granted scope:

| Managed Entity                                                        | System Admin (1) | Department Admin (4) | Editor (5) | Research Manager | Researcher | ML Eng. | Viewer | Researcher L1 | Researcher L2 | Environments Admin | Data Sources Admin | Compute Resources Admin | Templates Admin | Department Viewer |

Permissions:    **C** = Create, **R** = Read, **U** = Update, **D** = Delete

!!!Note

    1. *Admin* becomes *System Admin* with full access to all managed objects and scopes.
    2. *Research Manager* is **not** automatically assigned to all projects but to Projects set by the relevant *Admin* when assigning this role to a user, group, or app.
    3. To preserve backward compatibility, users with the role of *Research Manager* are assigned to all current projects, but not to new projects.
    4. To allow the *Department Admin* to assign a *Researcher* role to a user, group, or app, the *Department Admin* must have **CRUD** permissions for **Jobs** and **Workspaces**. This creates a broader span of managed objects.
    5. To preserve backward compatibility, users with the role *Editor*, are assigned to the same scope they had before the upgrade. However, with new user assignments, the *Admin* can limit the scope to only part of the organizational scope.
    6. *Department Admin* permissions for **Departments** remain **Read** as long as there is no hierarchy. Once a hierarchy is introduced, permissions need to change to **CRUD** to allow the *Department Admin* to create new Departments under its own department.
    7. Policies are accessible through **Clusters** using YAML files. There is no UI interface, although these policies affect UI elements (for example, Job Forms, Workspaces, Trainings).

### Scope

A *Scope* is an organizational component which accessible based on assigned roles. *Scopes* include:

* Projects
* Departments
* Clusters
* Tenant (all clusters)

### Asset

RBAC uses [rules](#access-rules) to ensure that only authorized users or applications can gain access to system assets. Assets that can have RBAC rules applied are:

* Departments
* Projects
* Deployments
* Workspaces
* Environments
* Quota management dashboard
* Training

### RBAC enforcement

RBAC ensures that user have access to system assets based on the rules that are applied to those assets. Should an asset be part of a larger scope of assets to which the user does not have access. The scope shown to the user will appear to be incomplete because the user is able to access **only** the assets to which they are authorized.

## Access rules

An *Access rule* is the assignment of a *Role* to a *Subject* in a *Scope*. *Access rules* are expressed as follows:

`<subject> is a <role> in a <scope>`.

**For example**:  
User **user@domain.com** is a **department admin** in **Department A**.

### Create or delete rules

To create a new access rule:

1. Press the ![Tools and Settings](../../admin-ui-setup/img/tools-and-settings.svg) icon, then *Roles and Access rules*.
2. Choose *Access rules*, then *New access rule*.
3. Select a user type from the dropdown.
4. Select a role from the dropdown.
5. Press the ![Scope](../../../images/scope-icon.svg) icon and select a scope, and press *Save rule* when done.

!!! Note
    You cannot edit *Access rules*. To change an *Access rule*, you need to delete the rule, create a new rule to replace it. You can also add multiple rules for the same user.

To delete a rule:

1. Press the ![Tools and Settings](../../admin-ui-setup/img/tools-and-settings.svg) icon, then *Roles and Access rules*.
2. Choose *Access rules*, then select a rule and press *Delete*.
