Below are instructions on how to install a Run:ai cluster.

## Prerequisites
Before installing, please review the installation prerequisites listed in [Run:ai GPU Cluster Prerequisites](cluster-prerequisites.md).

!!! Important
    We strongly recommend running the Run:ai [pre-install script](cluster-prerequisites.md#pre-install-script) to verify that all prerequisites are met. 

## Install Run:ai

Log in to Run:ai user interface at `<company-name>.run.ai`. Use credentials provided by Run:ai Customer Support:

* If no clusters are currently configured, you will see a Cluster installation wizard.
* If a cluster has already been configured, use the menu on the top left and select `Clusters`. On the top left, click `New Cluster`.

Using the cluster wizard:

* Choose a name for your cluster.
* Choose the Run:ai version for the cluster.
* Choose a target Kubernetes distribution (see [table](cluster-prerequisites.md#kubernetes) for supported distributions).
* (SaaS and remote self-hosted cluster only) Enter a URL for the Kubernetes cluster. The URL need only be accessible within the organization's network. For more informtaion see [here](cluster-prerequisites.md#cluster-url).
* Press `Continue`.

On the next page:

* (SaaS and remote self-hosted cluster only) Install a trusted certificate to the domain entered above.
* Run the [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) command provided in the wizard.
* In case of a failure, see the [Installation troubleshooting guide](../../troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md#installation).

!!! Note
    A kubernetes user with `cluster-admin` role is required to ensure a successfull installation, for more information see [using RBAC Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/){target=_blank}.

## Verify your cluster's health

* Verify that the cluster status in the Run:ai Control Plane's [Clusters Table](#cluster-table) is `Connected`.
* Go to the [Overview Dashboard](../../performance/dashboard-analysis.md#gpucpu-overview-dashboard-new-and-legacy) and verify that the number of GPUs on the top right reflects your GPU resources on your cluster and the list of machines with GPU resources appears on the bottom line.
* In case of issues, see the [Troubleshooting guide](../../troubleshooting/cluster-health-check.md).

## Researcher Authentication

If you will be using the Run:ai [command-line interface](../../researcher-setup/cli-install.md) or sending [YAMLs directly](../../../developer/cluster-api/submit-yaml.md) to Kubernetes, you must now set up [Researcher Access Control](../../authentication/researcher-authentication.md).

## Cluster Table

After you have installed your cluster on the platform, you will see it appear in the *Cluster Table*. The *Cluster Table* provides a quick and easy way to see the status of your cluster.

In the left menu, press *Clusters* to view the cluster table. Use *Add filter* to add one or more filter results based on the columns that are in the table. In the *Contains* pane, you can use partial or complete text. Filtered text is ***not*** case sensitive. To remove the filter, press *X* next to the filter.

The table provides the following columns:

* **Cluster**&mdash;the name of the cluster.
* **Kubernetes distribution**&mdash;the flavor of Kubernetes distribution.
* **Kubernetes version**&mdash;the version of Kubernetes installed.
* **Status**&mdash;the status of the cluster. For more information see [Cluster status](#cluster-status). Hover over the information icon to see a short description and links to troubleshooting.
* **Creation time**&mdash;the timestamp the cluster was created.
* **URL**&mdash;the URL that was given to the cluster at the time of creation.
* **Run:ai cluster version**&mdash;the Run:ai version installed on the cluster.
* **Run:ai cluster UUI**&mdash;the unique ID of the cluster.

### Cluster Status

The following table describes the different statuses that a cluster could be in.

| Status | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Waiting to connect | The cluster has never been connected. |
| Disconnected | There is no communication from the cluster to the Control Plane. This may be due to a network issue. |
| Missing prerequisites | At least one of the [Mandatory Prerequisites](cluster-prerequisites.md#prerequisites-in-a-nutshell) has not been met. |
| Service issues | At least one of the *Services* is not working properly. You can view the list of nonfunctioning services for more information |
| Connected | All services are connected and up and running. |

See the [Troubleshooting guide](../../troubleshooting/cluster-health-check.md) to help troubleshoot issues in the cluster.

## Customize your installation

To customize specific aspects of the cluster installation see [customize cluster installation](customize-cluster-install.md).

## Set Node Roles (Optional)

When installing a production cluster you may want to:

* Set one or more Run:ai system nodes. These are nodes dedicated to Run:ai software.
* Machine learning frequently requires jobs that require CPU but **not GPU**. You may want to direct these jobs to dedicated nodes that do not have GPUs, so as not to overload these machines.
* Limit Run:ai to specific nodes in the cluster.

To perform these tasks. See [Set Node Roles](../config/node-roles.md).

## Next Steps

* Set up Run:ai Users [Working with Users](../../authentication/users.md).
* Set up Projects for Researchers [Working with Projects](../../aiinitiatives/org/projects.md).
* Set up Researchers to work with the Run:ai Command-line interface (CLI). See  [Installing the Run:ai Command-line Interface](../../researcher-setup/cli-install.md) on how to install the CLI for users.
* Review [advanced setup and maintenance](../config/overview.md) scenarios.
