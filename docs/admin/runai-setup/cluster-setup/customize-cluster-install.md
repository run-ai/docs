# (Optional) Customize Cluster Installation

The Run:ai cluster creation wizard requires the download of a _Helm values file_ `runai-<cluster-name>.yaml`. The file may be edited to customize the cluster installation.


## Configuration Flags

|  Key     |  Default  | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------| 
| `pspEnabled` | `false` | Set to `true` when using [PodSecurityPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/){target=_blank} | 
| `ingress-nginx.podSecurityPolicy.enabled` | Set to `true` when using [PodSecurityPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/){target=_blank}  | 
| `runai-operator.config.project-controller.createNamespaces` | `true` | Set to `false`if unwilling to provide Run:ai the ability to create namespaces. When set to false, will requires an additional manual step when creating new Run:ai Projects | 
| `runai-operator.config.project-controller.createRoleBindings` | `true` | Set to `false` when using OpenShift. When set to false, will require an additional manual step when assigning users to Run:ai Projects | 
| `runai-operator.config.project-controller.clusterWideSecret` | `true` | Set to `false` when using PodSecurityPolicy or OpenShift | 
| `runai-operator.config.mps-server.enabled` | `false` | Set to `true` to allow the use of __NVIDIA MPS__. MPS is useful with _Inference_ workloads  | 
| `runai-operator.config.runai-container-toolkit.enabled` | `true` | Controls the usage of __Fractions__.  | 
| `runai-operator.config.global.runtime` | `docker` | Defines the container runtime of the cluster (supports `docker` and `containerd`). Set to `containerd` when using Tanzu | 
| `runai-operator.config.nvidiaDcgmExporter.namespace` | `gpu-operator` | The namespace where dcgm-exporter (or gpu-operator) was installed. |
| `runai-operator.config.nvidiaDcgmExporter.installedFromGpuOperator` | `true` | Indicated whether the dcgm-exporter was installed via gpu-operator or not. |
| `kube-prometheus-stack.enabled` |  `true`  | Set to `false` when the cluster has an existing Prometheus installation. that is __not based__ the Prometheus __operator__ . This setting requires Run:ai customer support. |
| `kube-prometheus-stack.prometheusOperator.enabled` |  `true`  |  Set to `false` when the cluster has an existing Prometheus installation __based__ on the Prometheus __operator__ and Run:ai should use the existing one rather than install a new one | 
| `prometheus-adapter.enabled` | `false` | Install Prometheus Adapter. Used for Inference workloads using a custom metric for autoscaling). Set to `true` if __Prometheus Adapter__ is not already installed in the cluster |
| `prometheus-adapter.prometheus` | The address of the default Prometheus Service | If you installed your own custom Prometheus Service, set this field accordingly with `url` and `port` |



### Feature Discovery

=== "Run:ai version 2.5 or higher"
    Not relevant

=== "Run:ai version 2.4 or lower"
    The Run:ai Cluster installation installs by default two pre-requisites:  Kubernetes [Node Feature Discovery (NFD)](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery){target=_blank} and [NVIDIA GPU Feature Discovery (GFD)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-feature-discovery){target=_blank}. 

    * If your Kubernetes cluster already has GFD installed, you will want to set `gpu-feature-discovery.enabled` to `false`. 
    * NFD is a prerequisite of GFD. If GFD is not installed, but NFD is already installed, you can disable NFD installation by setting `gpu-feature-discovery.nfd.deploy` to `false`. 

### Prometheus

The Run:ai Cluster installation uses [Promethues](https://prometheus.io/){target=_blank}. There are 3 alternative configurations:

1. (The default) Run:ai installs Prometheus.
2. Run:ai uses an existing Prometheus installation based on the Prometheus operator.
3. Run:ai uses an existing Prometheus installation based on a regular Prometheus installation.

For option 2, disable the flag `kube-prometheus-stack.prometheusOperator.enabled`. For option 3, please contact Run:ai Customer support. 

For options 2 and 3, if you enabled `prometheus-adapter`, please configure it as described in Prometheus Adapter [documentation](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/97f23f1ff7ca62f33ab4dd339cc62addec7eccde/charts/prometheus-adapter/values.yaml#L34)


## Understanding Custom Access Roles

To review the access roles created by the Run:ai Cluster installation, see [Understanding Access Roles](../config/access-roles.md)

<!-- 
## Add a Proxy

Allow outbound internet connectivity in a proxied network environment. See [Installing Run:ai with an Internet Proxy Server](proxy-server.md). -->

## Manual Creation of Namespaces

Run:ai Projects are implemented as Kubernetes namespaces. By default, the administrator creates a new Project via the Administration user interface which then triggers the creation of a Kubernetes namespace named `runai-<PROJECT-NAME> `.
There are a couple of use cases that customers will want to disable this feature:

* Some organizations prefer to use their internal naming convention for Kubernetes namespaces, rather than Run:ai's default `runai-<PROJECT-NAME>` convention.
* When PodSecurityPolicy is enabled, some organizations will not allow Run:ai to automatically create Kubernetes namespaces. 


Follow the following process to achieve this

1. Disable the namespace creation functionality. See the  `runai-operator.config.project-controller.createNamespaces` flag above.
2. [Create a Project](../../../admin-ui-setup/project-setup/#create-a-new-project) using the Run:ai User Interface. 
3. Create the namespace if needed by running: `kubectl create ns <NAMESPACE>`. The suggested Run:ai default is `runai-<PROJECT-NAME>`.
4. Label the namespace to connect it to the Run:ai Project by running `kubectl label ns <NAMESPACE>  runai/queue=<PROJECT_NAME>`

where  `<PROJECT_NAME>` is the name of the project you have created in the Run:ai user interface above and `<NAMESPACE>` is the name you chose for your namespace.
