title: SaaS Cluster Setup Introduction
---

This section is a step-by-step guide for setting up a Run:AI cluster. 

* A Run:AI cluster is installed on top of a Kubernetes cluster.
* A Run:AI cluster connects to the Run:AI backend on the cloud. The backend provides a control point as well as a monitoring and control user interface for Administrators.
* A customer may have multiple Run:AI Clusters, all connecting to a single backend.

For additional details see the [Run:AI system components](../../../home/components.md)

## Documents

* Review Run:AI cluster [prerequisites](cluster-prerequisites.md).
* Step by step [installation instructions](cluster-install.md).
* Look for [troubleshooting](cluster-troubleshooting.md) tips if required.
* [Upgrade cluster](cluster-upgrade.md) and [delete cluster](cluster-delete.md) instructions. 


## Customization

For a list of optional setup customizations see [Customize Installation](customize-cluster-install.md)

## Additional Configuration

For a list of advanced configuration scenarios such as configuring researcher authentication, Single sign-on limiting the installation to specific nodes, and more, see the [Configuration Articles](../advanced/overview.md) section.

## Next Steps

After setting up the cluster, you may want to start setting up Researchers. See: [Researcher Setup](../../researcher-setup/researcher-setup-intro.md).
