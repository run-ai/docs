# Overview: Developer Documentation

Developers can access Run:AI through programmatic interfaces. 

As part of the Developer documentation you will find:

* How to [authenticate](rest-auth.md) against the Run:AI REST API 
* __Researcher APIs__. These APIs work at the cluster level and allow you to submit, delete, and list Jobs. There are several API options:
    * Using [Researcher REST API](researcher-rest-api/overview.md).
    * Directly accessing [Kubernetes API](k8s-api/overview.md).
* [Administrator REST API](admin-rest-api/overview.md). A set of REST services to add, delete, modify and list Projects, Departments, Users, and other metadata. 
* [Inference API](inference/overview.md) to deploy inference workloads.
* [Metrics API](metrics/metrics.md) to retrieve metric data from Run:AI.
