#### Workloads - Workspaces and Training 

*  **Stop/run actions for distributed workloads** - You can now stop and run distributed workloads from the UI, CLI, and API. Scheduling rules for training workloads also apply to distributed workloads. This enhances control over distributed workloads, enabling greater flexibility and resource management. <span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#616161; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #616161; font-size:12px;">From cluster v2.20 onward</span>

* **Visibility into idle GPU devices** - Idle GPU devices are now displayed in in the UI and API showing the number of allocated GPU devices that have been idle for more than 5 minutes. This provides better visibility into resource utilization, enabling more efficient workload management.

* **Configurable workload completion with multiple runs** - You can now define the number of runs a training workload must complete to 
be considered finished directly in the UI, API, and CLI V2. Running training workloads multiple times improves 
the reliability and validity of training results. Additionally, you can configure how many runs can be scheduled in parallel, 
helping to significantly reduce training time and simplifying the process of managing jobs that require multiple runs.
See [standard training](../Researcher/workloads/training/standard-training/trainings-v2.md) for more details. <span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#616161; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #616161; font-size:12px;">From cluster v2.20 onward</span>

* **Configurable grace period for workload preemption** - You can now set a grace period in the UI, API and CLIv2 providing a 
buffer time for preempted workloads to reach a safe checkpoint before being forcibly preempted for
[standard](../Researcher/workloads/training/standard-training/trainings-v2.md) and [distributed training](../Researcher/workloads/training/distributed-training/distributed-training.md) workloads. 
The grace period can be configured between 0 seconds and 5 minutes. This aims to minimize data loss and avoid unnecessary retraining, ensuring the 
latest checkpoints are saved. <span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#616161; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #616161; font-size:12px;">From cluster v2.20 onward</span> 


#### Workload Assets

* **Instructions for environment variables** - You can now add instructions to environment variables when creating new environments via the UI and API. In addition, Run:ai's environments now include default instructions. Adding instructions provides guidance enabling anyone using the environment to set the environment variable values correctly. <span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#616161; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #616161; font-size:12px;">From cluster v2.20 onward</span>


* **Enhanced environments and compute resource management** - The action bar now contains "Make a Copy" and "Edit" while the "Rename" option has been removed. A new "Last Updated" column has also been added for easier tracking of asset modifications. <span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#616161; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #616161; font-size:12px;">From cluster v2.20 onward</span>


* **Enhanced data sources and credentials tables** - Added a new "Kubernetes name" column to data sources and credentials tables for visibility into Kubernetes resource associations. The credentials table now includes an  "Environments" column displaying the environments associated with the credential. <span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#616161; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #616161; font-size:12px;">From cluster v2.20 onward</span>

#### Authenitication and authorization

Each application includes client credentials which can be used to obtain an authentication token to utilize for subsequent API calls. 
See [User Applications](../developer/user-applications.md) for more details. <span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#616161; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #616161; font-size:12px;">From cluster v2.20 onward</span>

#### Scheduler

* **Support for multiple fractional GPUs in a single workload** - Run:ai now supports submitting workloads that utilize multiple fractional GPUs within a single workload using the UI and CLI. This feature enhances GPU utilization, increases scheduling probability in shorter timeframes, and allows workloads to consume only the memory they need. It maximizes quota usage and 
enables more workloads to share the same GPUs effectively. See [Multi-GPU fractions](../Researcher/scheduling/fractions.md#multi-gpu-fractions) and [Multi-GPU dynamic fractions](../Researcher/scheduling/dynamic-gpu-fractions.md#multi-gpu-dynamic-fractions) for more details. <span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#fc774a; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #fc774a; font-size:12px;">Beta for Dynamic Fractions</span> <span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#616161; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #616161; font-size:12px;">From cluster v2.20 onward</span>
 

* **Support for GPU memory swap with multiple GPUs per workload** - Run:ai now supports GPU memory swap for workloads utilizing multiple GPUs. 
By leveraging GPU memory swap, you can maximize GPU utilization and serve more workloads using the same hardware. 
The swap scheduler on each node ensures that all GPUs of a distributed model run simultaneously, maintaining synchronization across GPUs. 
Workload configurations combine swap settings with multi-GPU dynamic fractions, providing flexibility and efficiency for managing 
large-scale workloads. See [Multi-GPU memory swap](../Researcher/scheduling/gpu-memory-swap.md#multi-gpu-memory-swap). 
<span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#fc774a; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #fc774a; font-size:12px;">Beta</span> <span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#616161; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #616161; font-size:12px;">From cluster v2.20 onward</span>


#### Command Line Interface (CLI V2)

* **Support for Windows OS** - CLI V2 now supports Windows operating systems, enabling you to leverage the full 
capabilities of the CLI. <span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#616161; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #616161; font-size:12px;">From cluster v2.18 onward</span>

The `training` command now includes a new sub-command to support distributed workloads, ensuring a more consistent and streamlined user experience across both the CLI and UI.

* **New command for Kubernetes access** - Added a new CLI V2 command, `runai kubconfig set`, allowing users to set the 
kubeconfig file with Run:ai authorization token. This enhancement enables users to gain access to the Kubernetes cluster, 
simplifying authentication and integration with Run:ai-managed environments. 

* **Added view workload labels** - You can now view the labels associated with a workload when using the CLI V2 `runai workload describe` command for all workload types. This enhancement provides better visibility into workload metadata. 


### ML Engineers

#### Workloads - Inference

* **Enhanced visibility into rolling updates for inference workloads** - Run:ai now provides a phase message that provides detailed 
insights into the current state of the update, by hovering over the workload's status. This helps users to monitor and manage updates
more effectively. See [rolling inference updates](../Researcher/workloads/inference/inference-overview.md#rolling-inference-updates) for more details. <span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#616161; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #616161; font-size:12px;">From cluster v2.20 onward</span>

    * Number fields (e.g., `gpuPortionRequest`), 
    * Quantity fields (e.g., `gpuMemoryRequest`)

* **Pod deletion policy for terminal workloads** - Administrators can now specify which pods should be deleted when a distributed 
workload reaches a terminal state (completed/failed) using cleanPodPolicy in CLI V2 and API. This enhancement provides greater
control over resource cleanup and helps maintain a more organized and efficient cluster environment. See [cleanPodPolicy](../platform-admin/workloads/policies/policy-reference.md) for more details. 


#### Data sources

* **Improved control over data source and storage class visibility** - Run:ai now provides administrators with the ability 
to control the visibility of data source types and storage in the UI. Data source types that are restricted by policy 
will no longer appear during workload submission or when creating new data source assets. Additionally, administrators 
can configure storage classes as internal using the [Storage class configuration API](https://api-docs.run.ai/latest/tag/Storage-Classes). <span style="display:inline-block; background-color:white; color:#616161; padding:3px 8px; border-radius:3px; border:1px solid #616161; font-size:12px;">From cluster v2.20 onward</span>
