## January 2022 Run:AI Version 2.0

We have now stabilized on a single version numbering system for all Run:AI artifacts: 

* Run:AI Control plane (also called Backend).
* Run:AI Cluster.
* Run:AI Command-line interface.
* Run:AI Administrator Command-line interface.

Future versions will be numbered using 2 digits (2.0, 2.1, 2.2, etc.). Numbering for the different artifacts will vary at the third digit as we provide patches to customers. As such, in the future, the control plane can be tagged as 2.1.0 while the cluster tagged as 2.1.1.

### Release Contents

* To allow for better control over resource allocation, the Run:AI platform now provides the ability to define different over-quota priorities for projects. For full details see [Controlling over-quota behavior](../../admin/admin-ui-setup/project-setup/#controlling-over-quota-behavior).
* To help review and track resource consumption per department, the Department object was added to multiple dashboard metrics.

Supportability enhancements:

* A new tool was added, to allow IT administrators to validate cluster and control-plane installation pre-requisites. For full details see [cluster installation prerequisites](../../admin/runai-setup/cluster-setup/cluster-prerequisites/#pre-install-script), Kubernetes [self-hosted prerequisites](../../admin/runai-setup/self-hosted/k8s/prerequisites/#pre-install-script) or Openshift [self-hosted prerequisites](../../admin/runai-setup/self-hosted/ocp/prerequisites/#pre-install-script).
* To better analyze scheduling issues, node name was added to multiple scheduler log events.
