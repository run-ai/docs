## February 2025 releases


### February 16-23, 2025

#### Product enhancements

* NIM and model store: UX improvements
* New functionalities added for CLI v2:

    * Allow users to list all available Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) when submitting workloads. This enhancement simplifies the selection process for appropriate PVCs, making workload submission more efficient.
    * Enable users to display the config file in multiple formats.  The available options are:

        * --json: Output structure in JSON format
        * --yaml: Output structure in YAML format


#### Resolved Bugs 

| ID | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| RUN-25974 | Fixed an issue where using filters in the Quota management dashboard was not working properly. |
| RUN-25969 | Fixed an issue where the UI incorrectly rejected valid toleration key inputs during validation checks. |
| RUN-25946  | Fixed an issue where the Update Inference Spec API did not enforce a minimum cluster version returning a 400 Bad Request for versions below 2.19. |
| RUN-25921 | Fixed an issue where the Workspaces, Trainings and Distributed APIs did not enforce a minimum cluster version returning a 400 Bad Request for versions below 2.18. |
| RUN-25249 | Fixed an issue where submitting a workload using a yaml file with a port but without service type would use ClusterIP as the default service type. If no host port is provided, the target port will be used as the host. |
| RUN-25269 | Fixed an issue where the Pods modal was not paginated, limiting the display to only 50 records.  |
| RUN-25466 | Fixed an issue where an environment variable with the value SECRET was not valid as only SECRET:xxx was accepted. |
| RUN-23048 | Improved error handling to display meaningful messages from the CLI upgrade command. |
| RUN-25552 | Fixed an issue where clicking on "View Access Rules" in the Users table displayed only the first group if a user belonged to multiple groups. |
| RUN-25558 | Fixed a memory issue when handling external workloads (deployments, ray etc.) which when they were scaled caused ETCD memory to increase. |
| RUN-25659 | CLI v2: Fixed an issue where min and max replicas were able to be submitted using TensorFlow. |
