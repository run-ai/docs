# Getting familiar with workspaces 

Workspace is a simplified tool for researchers to conduct experiments, build AI models, access standard MLOps tools, and collaborate with their peers.

Run:ai workspaces abstract complex concepts related to running containerized workloads in a Kubernetes environment. Aspects such as networking, storage, and secrets, are built from predefined abstracted setups, that ease and streamline the researcher's AI model development.

A workspace consists of all the setup and configuration needed for the research, including container images, data sets, resource requests, as well as all required tools for the research, in a single place. 
This setup is set to facilitate the research needs and yet to ensure infrastructure owners keep control and efficiency when supporting the various needs.

A workspace is associated with a specific Run:ai project (internally: a Kubernetes namespace). A researcher can create multiple workspaces under a specific project.

Researchers can only view and use workspaces that are created under projects they are assigned to.

Workspaces can be created with just a few clicks of a button. See [Workspace creation](workspace-v2.md).  

Workspaces can be stopped and started to save expensive resources without losing complex environment configurations.

Only when a workspace is in status active (see also [Workspace Statuses](../overviews/managing-workloads.md#workload-status)) does it consume resources. 

When the workspace is active it exposes the connections to the tools (for example, a Jupyter notebook) within the workspace.

An active workspace is a Run:ai [interactive workload](../../../platform-admin/workloads/overviews/managing-workloads.md). The interactive workload starts when the workspace is started and stops when the workspace is stopped. 


Workspaces can be used via the user interface or programmatically via the Run:ai [Admin API](../../../developer/admin-rest-api/overview.md). Workspaces are not supported via the command line interface. You can still run an interactive workload via the command line.
