# Description

Submit a Run:ai Job for execution.

 Syntax notes:

* Flags of type *stringArray* mean that you can add multiple values. You can either separate values with a comma or add the flag twice.

## Examples

All examples assume a Run:ai Project has been setup using `runai config project <project-name>`.

Start an interactive Job:

```
runai submit -i ubuntu --interactive --attach -g 1
```

Or

```console
runai submit --name build1 -i ubuntu -g 1 --interactive -- sleep infinity 
```

(see: [build Quickstart](../Walkthroughs/walkthrough-build.md)).

Externalize ports:

```console
runai submit --name build-remote -i rastasheep/ubuntu-sshd:14.04 --interactive \
   --service-type=nodeport --port 30022:22
   -- /usr/sbin/sshd -D
```

(see: [build with ports Quickstart](../Walkthroughs/walkthrough-build-ports.md)).

Start a Training Job

```console
runai submit --name train1 -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 1 
```

(see: [training Quickstart](../Walkthroughs/walkthrough-train.md)).

Use GPU Fractions

```console
runai submit --name frac05 -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 0.5
```

(see: [GPU fractions Quickstart](../Walkthroughs/walkthrough-fractions.md)).

Hyperparameter Optimization

```console
runai submit --name hpo1 -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart-hpo -g 1  \
   --parallelism 3 --completions 12 -v /nfs/john/hpo:/hpo 
```

(see: [hyperparameter optimization Quickstart](../Walkthroughs/walkthrough-hpo.md)).

Submit a Job without a name (automatically generates a name)

```console
runai submit -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 1 
```

Submit a job using the system autogenerated name to an external URL:

```console
runai submit -i ubuntu --interactive --attach -g 1 service-type=external-url --port 3745 --custom-url=<destination_url>
```

Submit a job without a name to a system generated a URL :

```console
runai submit -i ubuntu --interactive --attach -g 1 service-type=external-url --port 3745
```

Submit a Job without a name with a pre-defined prefix and an incremental index suffix

```console
runai submit --job-name-prefix -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 1 
```

## Options

### Job Type

#### --interactive

> Mark this Job as interactive.

### Job Lifecycle

#### --completions < int >

> Number of successful pods required for this job to be completed. Used with HPO.

#### --parallelism < int >
>
> Number of pods to run in parallel at any given time.  Used with HPO.

#### --preemptible

### Naming and Shortcuts

#### --job-name-prefix `<string>`
>
> The prefix to use to automatically generate a Job name with an incremental index. When a Job name is omitted Run:ai will generate a Job name. The optional `--job-name-prefix flag` creates Job names with the provided prefix.

#### --name `<string>`
>
> The name of the Job.

#### --template `<string>`
>
> Load default values from a workload.

### Container Definition

#### --add-capability `<stringArray>`

> Add linux capabilities to the container.

#### -a | --annotation `<stringArray>`

> Set annotations variables in the container.

#### --attach

> Default is false. If set to true, wait for the Pod to start running. When the pod starts running, attach to the Pod. The flag is equivalent to the command [runai attach](runai-attach.md).
>
> The --attach flag also sets `--tty` and `--stdin` to true.

#### --command

> Overrides the image's entry point with the command supplied after '--'. When **not** using the `--command` flag, the entry point will **not** be overrided and the string after `--` will be appended as arguments to the entry point command.
>
> Example:
>
> `--command -- run.sh 1 54` will start the docker and run `run.sh 1 54`
>
> `-- script.py 10000` will augment `script.py 10000` to the entry point command (e.g. `python`)

#### --create-home-dir

> Create a temporary home directory for the user in the container. Data saved in this directory will not be saved when the container exits. For more information see [non root containers](../../admin/runai-setup/config/non-root-containers.md).

#### -e `<stringArray>` | --environment `<stringArray>`

> Define environment variables to be set in the container. To set multiple values add the flag multiple times (`-e BATCH_SIZE=50 -e LEARNING_RATE=0.2`).
 <!-- or separate by a comma (`-e BATCH_SIZE:50,LEARNING_RATE:0.2`). -->
  
#### --image `<string>` | -i `<string>`

> Image to use when creating the container for this Job

#### --image-pull-policy `<string>`

> Pulling policy of the image when starting a container. Options are:
>
> * `Always` (default): force image pulling to check whether local image already exists. If the image already exists locally and has the same digest, then the image will not be downloaded.
> * `IfNotPresent`: the image is pulled only if it is not already present locally.
> * `Never`: the image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image.
>
> For more information see Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/#container-images){target=_blank}.

#### -l | --label `<stringArray>`

> Set labels variables in the container.

> If possible, all pods of this job will be scheduled onto nodes that have a label with this key and identical values.

#### --required-pod-topology-key `<string>`

> Enforce scheduling pods of this job onto nodes that have a label with this key and identical values.

#### --stdin

> Keep stdin open for the container(s) in the pod, even if nothing is attached.is attached.

#### -t | --tty

> Allocate a pseudo-TTY.

#### --working-dir `<string>`

> Starts the container with the specified directory as the current directory.

### Resource Allocation

#### --cpu `<double>`

> CPU units to allocate for the Job (0.5, 1, .etc). The Job will receive **at least** this amount of CPU. Note that the Job will **not** be scheduled unless the system can guarantee this amount of CPUs to the Job.

#### --cpu-limit `<double>`

> Limitations on the number of CPUs consumed by the Job (for example 0.5, 1). The system guarantees that this Job will not be able to consume more than this amount of CPUs.

#### --extended-resource `<stringArray>`

> Request access to extended resource, syntax `<resource-name> = < resource_quantity >`

#### -g | --gpu `<float>`

> GPU units to allocate for the Job (0.5, 1).

#### --gpu-memory

> Use the format:
>
>`storageclass=  <storageclass>,size= <size>, path= <path>, ro, accessmode-rwm`

#### --s3 `<string>`

> Mount an S3 compatible storage into the container running the job. The parameter should follow the syntax:

### Network

<!-- 
#### --address `<string>`

> Comma separated list of IP addresses to listen to when running with --service-type portforward (default: localhost)
-->

#### --host-ipc

> Use the host's *ipc* namespace. Controls whether the pod containers can share the host IPC namespace. IPC (POSIX/SysV IPC) namespace provides separation of named shared memory segments, semaphores, and message queues.
> Shared memory segments are used to accelerate inter-process communication at memory speed, rather than through pipes or the network stack.
>
> For further information see [docker run reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) documentation.

#### --host-network

> Use the host's network stack inside the container.
> For further information see [docker run reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)documentation.

#### -s | --service-type `<string>`

> External access type to jobs. Options are:
>
> * `nodeport` - add one or more ports using `--port`.
> * `external-url` - add one port and an optional custom URL using `--custom-url`.
>
> For example:
>
> `runai submit test-jup -p team-a -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/jupyter-tensorboard --service-type external-url --port 8888`
>
> `runai submit test-np -p team-a -i ubuntu --service-type nodeport --port 30000:7070`
>
> This flag supports more than one `service-type`. Multiple service types are supported in CSV style using multiple instances of the same option and commas to separate the values for them.
>
> For example:
>
>`runai submit test-np -p team-a -i ubuntu --service-type nodeport,port=30000:7070 --service-type external-url,port=30001`
>
>`runai submit test-np -p team-a -i ubuntu --service-type nodeport,port=30000:7070,port=9090 --service-type external-url,port=8080,custom-url=https://my.domain.com/url`
>

#### --port `<stringArray>`

> Expose ports from the Job container. You can use a port number (for example 9090) or use the numbers of `hostport:containerport` (for example, 30000:7070).

#### --custom-url `<string>`

> An optional argument that specifies a custom URL when using the `external-url` service type. If not provided, the system will generate a URL automatically.

### Access Control

#### --allow-privilege-escalation

> Allow the job to gain additional privileges after start.

#### --run-as-user

> Run in the context of the current user running the Run:ai command rather than the root user. While the default container user is *root* (same as in Docker), this command allows you to submit a Job running under your Linux user. This would manifest itself in access to operating system resources, in the owner of new folders created under shared directories, etc. Alternatively, if your cluster is connected to Run:ai via SAML, you can map the container to use the Linux UID/GID which is stored in the organization's directory. For more information see [non root containers](../../admin/runai-setup/config/non-root-containers.md).

### Scheduling

#### --node-pools `<string>`

> Instructs the scheduler to run this workload using specific set of nodes which are part of a [Node Pool](../../Researcher/scheduling/the-runai-scheduler.md#). You can specify one or more node pools to form a prioritized list of node pools that the scheduler will use to find one node pool that can provide the workload's specification. To use this feature your Administrator will need to label nodes as explained here: [Limit a Workload to a Specific Node Group](../../admin/researcher-setup/limit-to-node-group.md) or use existing node labels, then create a node-pool and assign the label to the node-pool.
> This flag can be used in conjunction with node-type and Project-based affinity. In this case, the flag is used to refine the list of allowable node groups set from a node-pool. For more information see: [Working with Projects](../../admin/admin-ui-setup/project-setup.md).

#### --node-type `<string>`

> Allows defining specific Nodes (machines) or a group of Nodes on which the workload will run. To use this feature your Administrator will need to label nodes as explained here: [Limit a Workload to a Specific Node Group](../../admin/researcher-setup/limit-to-node-group.md).

#### --toleration `<string>`

> Specify one or more toleration criteria, to ensure that the workload is not scheduled onto an inappropriate node.
> This is done by matching the workload tolerations to the taints defined for each node. For further details see Kubernetes
> [Taints and Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/){target=_blank} Guide.
>
> The format of the string:
>
> ```
> operator=Equal|Exists,key=KEY,[value=VALUE],[effect=NoSchedule|NoExecute|PreferNoSchedule],[seconds=SECONDS]
> ```

### Global Flags

#### --loglevel (string)

> Set the logging level. One of: debug | info | warn | error (default "info")

#### --project | -p (string)

> Specify the Project to which the command applies. Run:ai Projects are used by the scheduler to calculate resource eligibility. By default, commands apply to the default Project. To change the default Project use `runai config project <project-name>`.

#### --help | -h

> Show help text.

## Output

The command will attempt to submit a Job. You can follow up on the Job by running `runai list jobs` or `runai describe job <job-name>`.

Note that the submit call may use a *policy* to provide defaults to any of the above flags.
