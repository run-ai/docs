  
This article explains the procedure to manage templates.

A template is a pre-set configuration that is used to quickly configure and submit workloads using existing assets. A template consists of all the assets a workload needs, allowing researchers to submit a workload in a single click, or make subtle adjustments to differentiate them from each other.

## Workspace templates table

The Templates table can be found under __Workload manager__ in the Run:ai User interface.

The Templates table provides a list of all the templates defined in the platform, and allows you to manage them.

!!! Note "Flexible Management"
    It is also possible to manage templates directly for a specific user, application, project, or department.
