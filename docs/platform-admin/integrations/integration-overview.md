# Integrations with Run:ai

The table below summarizes the integration capabilities with various third-party products. 

## Integration support

Support for integrations varies. Where mentioned below, the integration is supported out of the box with Run:ai. With other integrations,  our customer success team has previous experience with integrating with the third party software and many times the community portal will contain additional reference documentation provided on an as-is basis.

The Run:ai community portal is password protected and access is provided to customers and partners.

## Kubernetes Workloads Integration

Kubernetes has several built-in resources that encapsulate running *Pods*. These are called [Kubernetes Workloads](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/){target=_blank} and **should not be confused** with Run:ai Workloads.

Examples of such resources are a *Deployment* that manages a stateless application, or a *Job* that runs tasks to completion.

Run:ai natively runs Run:ai Workloads. A Run:ai workload encapsulates all the resources needed to run, creates them, and deletes them together. However, Run:ai, being an **open platform** allows the scheduling of **any** Kubernetes Workflow.

For more information see [Kubernetes Workloads Integration](../../developer/other-resources/other-resources.md).
