# Run:ai REST API

The purpose of the Run:ai REST API is to provide an easy-to-use programming interface for administrative tasks.

## Endpoint URL for API

The domain used for Run:ai REST APIs is the same domain used to browse for the Run:ai User Interface. Either `<company>.run.ai`, or `app.run.ai` for older tenants or a custom URL used for Self-hosted installations.

## Authentication

* Create a _Client Application_ to make API requests. Use the client application and secret, to obtain a time-bound bearer token (`<ACCESS-TOKEN>`). For details, see [Calling REST APIs](../rest-auth.md).
* Use the token for subsequent API calls.


## Example Usage

For example, if you have an Administrator role, you can get a list of clusters by running:

=== "cURL"
    ```
    curl 'https://<COMPANY-URL>/v1/k8s/clusters' \
    --header 'Accept: application/json' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS-TOKEN>'
    ```

=== "Python"
    ``` python
    import http.client

    conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("https://<COMPANY-URL>")
    headers = {
        'content-type': "application/json",
        'authorization': "Bearer <ACCESS-TOKEN>"
        }
    conn.request("GET", "/v1/k8s/clusters", headers=headers)

    res = conn.getresponse()
    data = res.read()

    print(data.decode("utf-8"))
    ```
(replace `<ACCESS-TOKEN>` with the bearer token from above).

For an additional example, see the [following](https://github.com/run-ai/docs/blob/master/examples/create-user-and-project.py){target=_blank} code. It is an example of how to use the Run:ai REST API to create a User and a Project and set the User to the Project.  

## Run:ai REST API Documentation

The Run:ai REST API offers developers a robust interface for interacting with and managing Run:ai metadata objects, including Projects, Departments, Clusters, and Users.

Public API documentation is available at [api-docs.run.ai](https://api-docs.run.ai){target=_blank}. For self-hosted deployments, access the documentation at `https://<control-plane-url>/api/docs`.

## Run:ai API Policy

At Run:ai, we are dedicated to delivering stable, reliable, and well-documented APIs. Our goal is to ensure that our APIs evolve in a predictable, transparent manner, offering users a seamless experience.

Run:ai follows strict API design and operational standards to ensure a consistent and high-quality experience for users.

### API Lifecycle and Deprecation

While our goal is to maintain stable and backward-compatible APIs, there may be times when breaking changes or deprecations are necessary.

In case of breaking changes, the deprecated version of the API will be supported for two additional versions in self-hosted deployments and for six months in SaaS deployments. During this period, no new features or functionality will be added to the deprecated API. 
When an API or API field is deprecated, the following process is followed:
Documentation: The deprecated API or field is clearly labeled in the documentation, with a replacement provided where applicable.
Release Notes: Information about deprecated APIs, including those scheduled for future removal, is included in the release notes.
Customer Notification: Customers are notified of upcoming deprecations as part of the regular release communications.

### API Removal

After the defined backward compatibility period has ended, deprecated APIs or fields are removed from both the codebase and the documentation.
